<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>In this task we enable rasterizing of single triangles of constant color which can be composed to rasterize more complex shapes. 
   Given 3 pixel coordinates to rasterize a triangle, we first determine the smallest bounding box that contains the entire triangle within the sample buffer. 
   We then go through each pixel within the triangle bounding box, and then perform the 3-line test on the center of the pixel (flooring the coordinates and offsetting by 0.5). 
   The center point is considered to be inside or on the triangle if the 3-line test determines the point is inside all of the lines or “outside” all of the lines (inverted case). 
   If the point is valid, we continue with rasterizing the point (calling the rasterize_point function), which maps the pixel in the sample buffer with the specified color. 
<br>
Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because we only check pixels within the range of the 
  minimum and maximum x coordinates and minimum and maximum y coordinates. This keeps the check within the bounding box of the triangle.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
  
  <p>In this task, we implement supersampling to reduce aliasing and jaggies in the simple triangle rasterization in task 1. 
    Supersampling entails sampling at a higher sampling rate than the frame buffer into our sample buffer and then using this extra sampling 
    for smoother rasterization in the frame buffer. </p>
  
  <p><b>Data Structures Modified</b>: We updated the sample_buffer to hold <i>height * width * sample_rate</i> colors, enabling us to store the color information of every single super sample. For <i>sample_rate</i> of 1, this will match the resolution of the <i>framebuffer</i>.</p>
  <p><b>Our supersampling algorithm is as follows:</b></p>
<p><ol>
  <li>In <i>rasterize_triangle</i>, we scale the input triangle coordinates by <i>sqrt(sample_rate)</i> pixels in each axis so the scaled coordinates 
    match the pixel coordinates as in the higher resolution version (the resized <i>sample_buffer</i>). We then iterate over the pixels of the triangle 
    bounding box in terms of the remapped pixel coordinates. At higher sampling rates, this means we test more points since each original (unscaled) 
    pixel was subdivided into <i>sample_rate</i> pixels. Iterating over these pixels, we conduct the 3-line-test as before and fill the color into the 
    <i>sample_buffer</i> if the pixels are within the triangle. This process should correctly map colors in the higher resolution <i>sample_buffer</i>.</li>
  <li>Since only <i>rasterize_triangle</i> had supersampling, we needed to ensure that <i>rasterize_point</i> and <i>rasterize_line</i> (which are not 
    supersampled), correctly map colors into the resized <i>sample_buffer</i>. This process was in the <i>fill_pixel</i> function. The default 
    <i>fill_pixel</i> used to directly map 1 pixel from <i>rasterize_line</i> or <i>rasterize_point</i> to a single pixel in the <i>sample_buffer</i>. 
    However, if the <i>sampling_rate</i> is now greater than 1 and we resize the <i>sample_buffer</i>, 1 pixel in <i>rasterize_line</i> or 
    <i>rasterize_point</i> actually maps to <i>sample_rate</i> number of pixels in the <i>sample_buffer</i>, so we modified <i>fill_pixel</i> to correctly
    fill in all the necessary pixels based on the <i>sampling_rate</i>.</li>
  <li>Finally, in <i>resolve_to_framebuffer</i>, we need to map our supersampled pixels back into the single pixel that actually maps to the 
    <i>framebuffer</i>. To do this, we iterate over the pixels of the <i>framebuffer</i> and pick out the <i>sample_rate</i> number of pixels in the 
    <i>sample_buffer</i> associated with the pixel. We then average the color of all these subsamples to set the pixel color of the <i>framebuffer</i>.</li>
  </ol></p>
  <p>For lines and points, supersampling won’t change anything since it is not implemented (i.e. all subsamples are the same color), but supersampling 
    is useful for toning down jaggies and any aliasing when rasterizing shapes based on triangles. It allows more consideration of the fact that the 
    one part of the pixel you sample might not reflect the entire pixel’s color. Instead pixels are colored based on how much of the pixel is actually 
    in the triangle, which allows for smoother changes in color at the edges of triangles as opposed to sharp abrupt changes without supersampling
    (only using a single center point sample) that make aliasing more prominent. Viewed at a larger scale, the image’s edges also look smoother with 
    the antialiasing.</p>
  
<p>Supersampling entailed the following modifications to the rasterization pipeline (based on steps from cs184 project 1, task 2 specification):
  <ul>
    <li>We modified the line/triangle/point rasterization step. Rasterizing the triangles for the interior image will supersample based on the 
      <i>sample_rate</i> into a <i>sample_buffer</i> that may be resized so not all pixels of the original pixel may map to the same color. 
      Additionally rasterizing points and lines will fill into multiple pixels in the <i>sample_buffer</i> based on larger sample rates (Step 3).</li>
    <li>When rasterizing the square boundary, since lines are being rasterized, the <i>sample_buffer</i> in between may map multiple pixels if the 
      sample is greater than 1 but this does not have any effect on the actual <i>framebuffer</i> since they are averaged out again (Step 4).</li>
    <li>Based on the <i>sample_rate</i> increasing, it is no longer a 1:1 mapping between the <i>sample_buffer</i> and <i>framebuffer</i>, so instead 
      of directly mapping the <i>sample_buffer</i> pixels to the <i>framebuffer</i> pixels, colors of the <i>sample_buffer</i> are averaged and then
      the <i>framebuffer</i> takes on the average color of the supersampled pixels (Step 5).</li>
  </ul>
</p>
    
<p>Below are the results of rendering <i>basic/test4.svg</i> at from sample rates of 1, 4, and 16, which show less aliasing and jaggies as the 
  <i>sample_rate</i> increases. In the zoomed in view, we can see different shades of the original color (from the supersampling and averaging) 
  on the border once the <i>sample_rate</i> is greater than 1, and comparing <i>sample_rate</i> 4 and 16 we can see a larger variation in shades 
  of the original color with <i>sample_rate</i> of 16. These extra variations of color let the border seem smoother and more accurate on the main rendered image.</p>

  <p>In this task, we implemented pixel transformations including translation, scaling, and rotation. As a demonstration, we rendered the given 
    cubeman with some modifications. We gave the cubeman a fancy shirt and a hat, and had him dance with one arm up and one arm down, picking up 
    one leg, bent at the knee, which we achieved by rotating and translating some of his limbs.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

  <p>Barycentric coordinates are weights assigned to describe the location of a point within a triangle and are useful for linearly interpolating for some value at that point, given values at the vertices. Specifically, for a given point, barycentric coordinates are 3 weights that sum to 1 based on the point’s location relative to the triangle’s vertices. 
  </p>
  <p>While rasterizing multicolored polygons, this is useful for creating color blends and gradients.</p>
  <p>For example, if you look at the image aid of the triangle below, for each point inside the triangle, we compute the 3 barycentric coordinates and treat these coordinates as weights for colors at each vertex (red, blue, green). By adding the weighted colors together, you can get a color that is a gradient between the 3 vertices. In this case, point V has more green and blue in it, and less red, and which will be reflected in the three corresponding alpha, beta, and gamma weights.
  </p>
  <p>Below is also a full color wheel we rasterized that showcases blending and gradients.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

  <p>Pixel sampling samples the color at a specific location on another reference image to rasterize points within a triangle. In texture mapping this refers to sampling a texture map to rasterize an image. Since we are only given triangle screen space vertices and its corresponding (u, v) texture space coordinates, for each point within the triangle we can use the barycentric coordinate weights (similar to part 4) to interpolate where a pixel within the triangle maps in the texture space. Based on this mapping, we sample the texture space to then rasterize that pixel according to the color of the texture space pixel. In our implementation these interpolated (u, v) coordinates for each pixel within the triangle were used differently by each of the 2 sampling methods in order to determine the color for the pixel in the screen space. Note that this implementation was built on top of supersampling as well, so screen space mapping technically maps to all the subpixels in our sample buffer based on the sample rate. Additionally, in our implementation to compute the barycentric coordinates, we initially did computations with linear algebra, but later decided to use analytic formulas because we wanted to avoid any floating point rounding issues that may arise when inverting matrices.</p>
  <p>Once we have the texture space (u, v) coordinates that we would like to sample, there are two pixel sampling methods we can use to obtain the color:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nearest sampling: Based on the texel that the (u,v) coordinate falls in, directly sample that texel’s color. The texel the point falls in can be obtained by flooring the (u, v) coordinates so it indexes into the mipmap correctly.</li>
      <li>Bilinear sampling: Bilinear sampling will consider the 4 nearest texels to the (u,v) coordinates (one of which the (u, v) coordinate is inside of), and uses linear interpolations (lerp) to weight the colors of the texels to assign a final color. There are 2 intermediate lerps, which interpolate the colors in the two rows, and then there is a final lerp to interpolate the colors from the two rows.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<p>Below, we are comparing four screenshots of the UC Berkeley Seal using nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel.</p>

<br>
<p>Overall, bilinear sampling produces a much smoother color blending when rendering the image with the texture map and is more pleasant to look at. When viewed through the zoom lens, this is evident especially at a sample rate of 1 where the edges of the letter “B” are sharp and blocky for the nearest sampling while bilinear sampling shows smoother shifts in colors of the pixels, almost similar to the nearest sampling at sampling rate of 16. Overall, these differences are more pronounced at low sample rate, and there is not too much noticeable difference between the sampling methods at a rate of 16. This is because supersampling helps antialias in the screen space when rasterizing into the frame buffer whereas bilinear sampling helps antialias in the texture space when interpolating between the 2 spaces. As a result, when we have no antialiasing at the screen space level at a sample rate of 1, the effects of antialiasing at the texture space level (with bilinear filtering) are much more apparent. </p>
